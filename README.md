# Web Editor
This project is a web editor built from using the extremely helpful *create-react-app* command. 
</br></br>
Its function is to help an individual with no programming knowledge build their own website with minimal effort and a user-friendly UI.
</br></br>
My goal with starting this project was to better familarize myself with the powerhouse, **Javascript** and a few of its popular libraries such as **React** and **Redux**.

## Examples

###### *The default layout gives the user a "hello wrld" text box on an otherwise blank slate.*
<div>
  <img src="git images/Startup.png" width="639" height="341" />
</div>

</br>

###### *When a component is clicked, the editor opens showing several properties of the item you're viewing.*
<div>
  <img src="git images/EditorOpen.png" width="639" height="341" />
</div>

</br>

###### *The editor has many useful features such as a history of your past inputs and suggestions for common properties given the attribute with everything being contextual to the type of object and the attribute you've selected.*
<div>
  <img src="git images/TextColorChange.png" width="639" height="341" />
</div>

</br>

###### *Nothing too exciting, but here is an example of something one could make using only the Web App.*
<div>
    <img src="git images/WebsiteSample.png" width="639" height="341" />
</div>
