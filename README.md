# Web Editor
This project is a web editor built from using the extremely helpful create-react-app command. Its function is to help someone who has no programming knowledge build their own website with minimal effort and a user-friendly UI. My goal with starting this project was to better familarize myself with the powerhouse, Javascript and a few of its popular libraries such as React and Redux.
