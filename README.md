# Web Editor
This project is a web editor built from using the extremely helpful *create-react-app* command. 
</br></br>
Its function is to help an individual with no programming knowledge build their own website with minimal effort and a user-friendly UI.
</br></br>
My goal with starting this project was to better familarize myself with the powerhouse, **Javascript** and a few of its popular libraries such as **React** and **Redux**.
